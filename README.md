# Heim - home control for Node.js

Heim is a API for home automation that is powered by [node.js](https://nodejs.org). It provides easy implementation for home control and task automation.

Heim draws inspiration from the [pimatic framework](https://github.com/pimatic/pimatic), but works more like a REST API.

**NOTICE** *Heim is still under development. Nothing works perfectly yet!*
